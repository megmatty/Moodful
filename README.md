# Moodful: The Mindful Mood Tracker

### Summary
Moodful is way for you to track and analyze your moods while using some basic mindfulness principles. Mindfulness means focusing your mind to be fully present and aware of where you are and what you’re doing, without being overly reactive to what's going on around you.
Moodful is a way to capture, track, and monitor your daily moods. Over time, you can become more mindful of your feelings and what events or thoughts might affect them. Moodful offers a simple interface for creating a record of your mood, daily activities, and your thoughts about the day. In addition to displaying your log entries, Moodful provides a "mood cloud" and graph of your last 10 moods, as well as your last journal for you to reflect upon. Reviewing this information can further help you gain better awareness of how you feel over time.
